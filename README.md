    <h1> Top Five Reasons To Hire Daniella Granzotto</h1>

    <ol>
      <li> I love people. </li>
      <p> I find people extremely fascinating. I have had quite an eclectic range
        of jobs over the last couple years from dance teacher, to server, to manager
        of a hair salon and several retailers.  The one thing all these places had in
        common however, was that they were people facing and people focused. </p>

      <li> I am obsessed with learning. </li>
      <p> If I am interested in something, I want to know as much about it as I possibly can.
        It really doesn&#39;t matter what the topic is, I love to learn. Whether it be the
        tailoring and sewing class I just finished taking, or my latest obsession with
        starting to learn how to code. If there is something I don&#39;t know, believe me I will
        figure it out. </p>

      <li> I love hard work. </li>
      <p> My dad used to tell me that success was 30% talent and 80% hard work.
        When I pointed out that that was actually 110% he said <q>exactly</q>. It was dorky dad
        advice at the time, but it stuck with me. I genuinely enjoy working hard and being part of a team
      that has a common goal of making something great happen. </p>

      <li> I am an outside of the box thinker. </li>
      <p> I thrive in moments where something breaks or goes wrong and I have to think
        quick on my feet to find an unconventional way to fix it.  Auxiliary cord broke ten
        minutes into a four hour car ride- no problem.  I (literally) used bandaids that
        I had in my purse to put it back together: music crisis averted. Bridesmaid forgot the
          bride&#39;s garter belt- I made one in less than ten minutes using hair elastics, tulle, and
          little blue bows that were stuck to the invitations. If you&#39;re ever in need
          of a quick <q>fixer-upper</q> trust me, I&#39;m your gal.
       </p>

      <li> I am passionate about ecommerce. </li>
      <p> It&#39;s quite difficult for me to specifically tell you why I&#39;m so passionate
      about it. Perhaps it&#39;s because of all my experience in <q>brick and mortar</q> retail. I love
    the idea that ecommerce takes the heirarchy out of retail. Because everything is just a click away the up and comer, or the  <q>little guy</q> can thrive
   in ways that he couldn&#39;t before. Suddenly people&#39;s options to choose who they purchase from
 and why are endless, and it&#39;s only getting better from here. </p>

    <h2> Top Five Completely Irrelevant Reasons To Hire Daniella Granzotto </h2>

    <ol>
      <li> I am a mildly entertaining person at least 50% of the time. At that rate you are most
        likely guaranteed one mediocre chuckle at least every second time you engage with me. </li>

      <li> I once was the <q>call a friend</q> card on a game show AND met Jennifer Aniston in the
        same day. Yes, I got the question right, and yes, she&#39;s perfect in real life. </li>

      <li> I am not athletic in the least, but I have yet to meet my match at air hockey. That&#39;s
        not bragging, it&#39;s just a fact. Okay, it&#39;s a little bit bragging... P.S. Challengers to that fact are always
        welcome. </li>

      <li> I can pretty much quote the entire movie <q>The Sandlot</q> from start to finish. If you
        haven&#39;t seen it, you missed out on an integral part of childhood. After all, it&#39;s about a bunch of kids who
        play baseball, and The Great Bambino!</li>

      <li> I have an IMDB credit for being a special effects makeup artist on a motion picture.</li>
    </ol>

    <p> And that&#39;s about all folk&#39;s!</p>
